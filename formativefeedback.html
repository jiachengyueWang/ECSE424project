<b>  <font size="+2">Results and Analysis</font></b><br>
<b>  <font size="+1">Participant Benchmark Test Results: </font></b><br>

<ul class="w3-ul " style="font-weight: bold;">
  <li class="w3-justify">Task 1: Open application and calibrate devices </li>
  <p class="w3-justify"> Average Time Taken: 155</p>
  <p class="w3-justify">Qualitative Observations: This task is simple and straightforward, none of the users had a problem conducting this task. All of them quickly spotted the icon and completed the task.</p>

  <li class="w3-justify">Task 2: Indicate “Raise Hand” using Zoom </li>
  <p class="w3-justify"> Average Time Taken: 1.5</p>
  <p class="w3-justify"> Qualitative Observations: This task is simple and straightforward, none of the users had a problem conducting this task. All of them quickly spotted the icon and completed the task. </p>

  <li class="w3-justify">Task 3: Indicate “Raise Hand” using simulated gesture</li>
  <p class="w3-justify"> Average Time Taken: 20</p>
  <p class="w3-justify">  Qualitative Observations: The average time taken for this task is much longer than the other similar tasks involving indicating the users themselves as “Raised Hand”. Because there were no responses on the computer, all the users thought they were doing something wrong. None of the users successfully completed the task, some of them tried multiple times reconnecting and re-calibrating the phone, but this function does not seem to be working. Also, in 2 of the tests, the users’ phone sensors seem to be way too sensitive, the phone screen still turns to green and shows that “Raised Hand” when the phone is lying on a flat surface or slightly lifted.  </p>

  <p class="w3-justify">  “I thought something was wrong with the package, so I deleted the application and re-downloaded it again, but no, still nothing. See? I’m raising my hand, but nothing is showing on the computer” --Joshua.</p>

  <li class="w3-justify">Task 4: Indicate “Raise Hand” using “Raise Hand” button in the application </li>
  <p class="w3-justify"> Average Time Taken: 1.5</p>
  <p class="w3-justify">  Qualitative Observations: This task is very easy, the menu bar in the application is obvious and clear. All the users had no problems looking for the icon and clicked them to complete this task. </p>

  <li class="w3-justify">Task 5: Indicate “Raise Hand” using keyboard shortcut </li>
  <p class="w3-justify"> Average Time Taken: 1.25</p>
  <p class="w3-justify">  Qualitative Observations: This task is easy as well, the corresponding keyboard shortcuts are indicated in all of the buttons, so the users can quickly complete the task. Some of them tried the shortcuts for other buttons as well. </p>

  <li class="w3-justify">Task 6: I Indicate “Raise Hand” using global shortcut key while focused on the zoom chat window </li>
  <p class="w3-justify"> Average Time Taken: 13.4</p>
  <p class="w3-justify">  Qualitative Observations: This task is a little bit trickier than task5, since the keyboard shortcuts shown in the menu bar are a single letter written in brackets. Some of the users know immediately that in order to use the global shortcut key needs to press ALT as well, some of them do not. And for those who do not know, when they are typing messages in the chat window, pressing a letter key on the keyboard is actually inputting a new letter in the chat message. It took some time for them to find out that pressing the Alt key is also required, one of the users did not figure out how to use the global shortcut key in the end. </p>
  <p class="w3-justify">  “How do you use the shortcut key when you are typing the message? It says the shortcut is “H”, but if I press H, won’t it just appear in the message?” -- Astro. </p>

  <li class="w3-justify">Task 7: Ask a question using chat </li>
  <p class="w3-justify"> Average Time Taken: 6.6</p>
  <p class="w3-justify"> Qualitative Observations: This task is relatively easy. All of the users know how to open the chat window and how to ask a question using chat. However, not all of them figured out how to tag the questions with “#Q”. One of the users asked the facilitator how to tag the question exactly. But all of them figured it out at the end.</p>
  <p class="w3-justify"> “I know how to post a question, but how do you tag it? Do you just type #Q yourself, or do you need to click on something to tag it?” -- Luna. </p>


</ul> 

<br>
<b>  <font size="+1">Presenter Benchmark Test Results: </font></b><br>

<ul class="w3-ul " style="font-weight: bold;">
  <li class="w3-justify">Task 1: Open application and start a meeting 
</li>
  <p class="w3-justify"> Average Time Taken: 95</p>
  <p class="w3-justify">Qualitative Observations: This task is very easy and straightforward. None of the users had problems when doing this task. 
</p>

  <li class="w3-justify">Task 2: Attend to questions and filter questions</li>
  <p class="w3-justify"> Average Time Taken: 5.75</p>
  <p class="w3-justify"> Qualitative Observations: Attending questions was not easy to perform, neither is filtering questions, but filtering questions are a bit confusing for the users. It seems like that the “filtering questions” function only filters the messages posted by the user. For example, if a participant posted some messages in the chat window, some of the messages are tagged with questions and some of them are just normal text, and when the presenter uses the filtering function by clicking on the filtering questions button, nothing will happen. Because the messages are sent by another individual. But if the participant who sent the messages clicks on the filtering question button, the function works perfectly. </p>
  <p class="w3-justify"> It causes confusion since the function is supposed to help the presenter filtering the questions asked by participants. </p>
  <p class="w3-justify"> “I do not see the point of filtering if I can only filter my own messages, I thought it helps me to filter the students’ questions so that it is easier for me to go over the chats.” -- Bessie </p>

  <li class="w3-justify">Task 3: Monitor feedback </li>
  <p class="w3-justify"> Average Time Taken: 23.75</p>
  <p class="w3-justify">    Qualitative Observations: This task is very easy. All the presenter managed to monitor the feedback from the participants through the chat window.</p>
</ul> 

<br>
<b>  <font size="+1">Similarities and Differences </font></b><br>

<ul class="w3-ul " style="font-weight: bold;">
  <li class="w3-justify">Similarities: </li>
  <p class="w3-justify">For those easy and straightforward tasks, almost all the users can perform the tasks without any problems or any assistance, such as open the application and click the “Raise Hand” button. For the task of indicating “Raise Hand” by simulated hand gesture, almost all the users had problems performing the task. </p>

  <li class="w3-justify">Differences:</li>
  <p class="w3-justify"> Users had different understandings about the methods to tag a question. Some users did not know how to use the global shortcut keys to indicate “Raise Hand”.</p>
  
</ul> 
<br>
<b>  <font size="+1">Prioritized Usability Issues </font></b><br>

<ul class="w3-ul " style="font-weight: bold;">
  <li class="w3-justify">Priority Level: High  </li>
  <p class="w3-justify">Simulated Gestures does not function as stated in the user manual: As described in the task qualitative observation, the simulated gesture does not function. This is the main function of the application, and we do not see any responses on the computer. One of the possible reasons could be the failure of linking the phone with the computer.</p>
 
  <li class="w3-justify">Priority Level: Medium  </li>
  <p class="w3-justify">Calibration does not work: The setting up of the application includes a calibration process at the beginning to link the phone with pre-installed application with the computer. However, in the testing, the calibration process does not seem to be working. It indicates success even though no phone app is presented. This is medium priority because if the calibration process has problems, such as calibration successfully completed without phones linked, it can cause the simulated gesture function to fail as well.</p>
  <p class="w3-justify">Sensor way too sensitive: A sensitive sensor can fail the main function of the application, simulated gestures, to fail as well. Based on the observations from the testings, the sensor does not correctly indicate the user hand status. The phone application shows “Raised Hand” even though the user is not raising his/her hand sometimes.</p>

  <li class="w3-justify">Priority Level: Low</li>
  <p class="w3-justify"> Fix the shortcut remainder on the button: The shortcut on the buttons of the menu bar only shows the letter, pressing the letter works fine for most of the time, but does not work if the user is typing a message in the chat window. Some of the users might get confused on how to use the global shortcut keyboard. Therefore, it might be clearer if ALT is also included in the button.</p>
  
</ul> 
<br>
<b>  <font size="+2">Test Plan Critique</font></b><br>
<p class="w3-justify"> Overall, the test plan is very thorough and effective for us to conduct an evaluation. During the process, some compliments and feedback of improvements are gathered from test subjects. They will be listed below in terms of different categories of the testing plan.</p>

<br>
<b>  <font size="+2">User Manual</font></b><br>
<p class="w3-justify"> The installation guide or user manual provides detailed instructions for users to download the applications and guides them how to appropriately use the system. However, there is a limitation of the required operating system for both PC and cell phones. As they are restricted to Windows and Android, It is kind of hard to find the test subjects, which means the target user group gets shrinked in some extent due to this limitation. Although it is understood that this is only a computer prototype, it is better to figure out a way to satisfy the preference of the majority by letting more people get involved.</p>


<b>  <font size="+2">Usability Goals</font></b><br>

<ul class="w3-ul " style="font-weight: bold;">
<p class="w3-justify"> Goal number five and additional goal number three are the same thing.</p>
  <li class="w3-justify">1.  Goal number one is not met exactly:</li>
  <p class="w3-justify"> It is noticed that when a participant raises hands via no matter what kind of method like raising hand by the button and gesture, there will be a pop-up message indicating someone has raised his or her hands. However, it is too small to be notified. Especially, when a presenter is giving a speech about a certain topic, he or she might be away from keyboards so that the little message might be missed out.</p>

  <li class="w3-justify">2.   Goal number two is not met that the rationale of this goal is similar to the one above:</li>
   <p class="w3-justify"> Additionally, the filtering function can only work locally. During the evaluation, users can only filter questions posted by themselves, which is nonsense and not useful. For example, if the presenter wants to filter out all the questions, he or she cannot get the results as participants posted questions with tagged #Q on their ends not on the presenter’s end. It should be fixed that all the tagged questions are shared so that everyone can filter out the questions no matter who posted them.</p>

  <li class="w3-justify">3.    Goal number four is not met exactly: </li>
   <p class="w3-justify"> The interface is kind of confusing when first using it. It is required to resize the ZOOM window to an appropriate size to get fitted by the HandsUp software, but it is hard to do that manually in fact. Users did not know each functionality in HandsUp corresponds to the one in ZOOM For example, they are confused that they do not know which interface to use when they want to unmute or open the participant list. It should be justified in the user manual to give a better understanding of what type of the software it is.</p>
</ul> 

<br>
<hr>

<b>  <font size="+2">Reporting</font></b><br>
<p>Data collection sheet is not well formed and organized. Development team should include some expectations on the intended outcomes instead of leaving it blank since we as an evaluation team do not design and implement the software ourselves, which makes it difficult to decide the intended outcomes. In addition, the data collection sheet lacks some contents that are mentioned under the What to Record section in Reporting. It should include the number of failures (tries) as well.</p>

<br>

<b>  <font size="+2">Usability Evaluation</font></b><br>
<p>Most heuristic evaluations are related to the HandsUp software, but from the feedback we have received from test subjects, some heuristics are not met. 
For example, Visibility of System Status. The incrementation of the number of unanswered questions sometimes fails to function (suddenly drop to zero) andpop-up messages of new questions on the presenter’s side cannot be notified easily.</p>
<p>Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors. All the tested users found the error that they could not get the phone app connected to the computer program and there was no information provided to solve the issue (tried to redownload the software but still failed).</p>
<p>In addition, Aesthetic and Minimalist Design is not present in the computer prototype. The interface of HandsUp and ZOOM are highly overlapped and some of the designs are unnecessary like mute/unmute and participants. Users can use these functionalities in ZOOM, there is no need to provide these to cause any further confusion. The development team should take this into consideration to provide a complete and wider heuristic evaluation.</p>

<br>
<b>  <font size="+2">Design Critique</font></b><br>

<ul class="w3-ul " style="font-weight: bold;">

  <li class="w3-justify">1.  Displaying double interfaces that are similar. </li>
  <p class="w3-justify"> From users’ perspectives, the first impression of a software is the interface. In this design, users have to deal with two interfaces overlapping with each other and they need to resize the ZOOM window to fit into the HandsUp interface. It is really sophisticated for them to use the app since resizing manually may take some time to make the window wider or longer. A good design should never do that.</p>
  <p class="w3-justify">The primary goal is to keep the system simple and easy to navigate. The development team can try to do supplemental software with a neat and clear interface that only includes the HandsUp functionality to avoid displaying two similar interfaces. Or The development team can shrink the size of their interface to make it no longer take the whole screen, implement a navigation drawer that includes essential features, and let the users watch the meeting video directly on ZOOM not through HandsUp interface. This fails the heuristic “Aesthetic and minimalist design”.</p>


  <li class="w3-justify">2.    Archery bow hand gloves are unnecessary. </li>
   <p class="w3-justify"> It is still uncertain to know your final decision of how HandsUp receives signals from users. Through the gloves or the phone app? The development team mentioned a design evolution about the gloves and when it comes to the test plan, they use a phone app to release signals. It is suggested to use the phone app as it is a more convenient way and barely no one is willing to wear a glove with electrical wires attached to it, which is kind of old fashioned and dangerous. As for the phone app, everyone can have easy access to download it and they don’t need additional time to get used to it. But many test subjects complained about the accuracy and stability of the phone app, it seemed like it cannot tell if users’ hands are raised or not (a slight shake can cause the status to change). The suggestion is to keep using the phone app and enhance its accuracy and stability.
 </p>

  <li class="w3-justify">3.    Filtering questions can only work locally.</li>
   <p class="w3-justify"> For both presenter and participants, questions tagged with #Q cannot be filtered out if the questions are not posted by them. Each user can only use this function to filter his or her own questions, which is a flawed design that it should be supposed to filter out all the tagged questions, otherwise the design itself is pointless. We think it might be a bug that needs to be fixed so that all the questions can be filtered out. To make it more advanced, the development team could add more features to it like filtering responses and etc.</p>

  <li class="w3-justify">4.    No exit button to go back to the main menu.</li>
  <p class="w3-justify"> During the process of evaluation, many users failed to get the phone app connected to the computer software. After clicking the begin a new session button, there is no way to go back to the previous menu to try to reconnect. Thus, users have to exit the whole program and restart it. The connection failure occurs sometimes, the development team should take this into consideration to make a design of the exit button. A back or exit button should solve this problem completely. Therefore, the heuristic “User control and freedom” is not met by the software.</p>
