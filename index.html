<b>Setting A: A lecture via videoconferencing </b><br>
An electrical engineering professor is giving a lecture of CPU boards to students via an online platform, the professor is holding up a CPU board and explaining the functions of each section of the board. One of the students has a question about the board, the student wants to know the function of a slot on the board, the only way of communicating with the professor is through the audio. In order to know which part the student is referring to, the professor holds the board closer up to the camera, and moves his finger with directions the student gives until he reaches the right spot. The professor answers the question and keeps going with the explanation of the CPU board.

<b>Observations to persona:</b> In this scenario, the student is trying to specify the part of the CPU board that he has questions about to the professor, and eventually the professor managed to get to the right location by following the instructions the student gave. However, in the case of a more complex object, for example, a 3D model of the human nerve system, the actions taken in setting A would not be sufficient.  The observation leads to persona 1, David, the electrical engineering student.

<b>Setting B: A discussion via videoconferencing</b><br>
A team is working on building a 3D model of a temple, they made a model with the data collected from measuring the temple, but later on, they found out that some of the data collected were false, so they are having a video conference discussing the modifications required on the temple model. One of the team members has the hold of the model, the rest of the team members are feeding the member with the newly collected data information so that he can make marks of the locations that need modifications. One of the members suffers from social phobia, usually he just sends out text messages to work with the team, and it has been going smoothly until this incident. Under this circumstance, the best option would be to turn on the audio and the video to specify the location with the false data to the member with the hold of the model. The process is hard for him and takes a considerable amount of time.

<b>Observations to persona:</b>  In this scenario, the member suffers from social phobia and has a hard time communicating with the rest of the team using video and audio. But knowing that guiding in text messages is not likely to help other members get the right location any time soon, in order to get the project done in time, he has to use body gestures and give direction instructions. Talking and using body gestures to a group of people can be very hard for someone suffering from social phobia, and if we have another alternative for addressing this problem, it does not just save time but also gives a more comfortable video conferencing environment for people with special needs.
The observation leads to persona 2, Roderick, the team member who suffers from social phobia.

<b>  <font size="+2">Problem</font></b><br>
Communicating in videoconference has always been a challenging task, even though we have both the video and audio synchronised nowadays, the experience of communicating in videoconference is not as real as the experience of an in-person meeting. 
The problem was observed in the settings described above in the observation section. Due to the limitations of the angle and the size of the camera, making the communication smoother is even more challenging in a meeting regarding complex objects or systems. Use the scenario stated in Observation 1, where a professor is giving a presentation of a CPU board, specifying a location on the board to the students is easy, since the professor has hold of the CPU board, he simply just needs to point to the object and that is clear enough to the students. But the other way around is tricky. In a presentation like this, it is likely that not all of the students  would have the hold of the same CPU board, and without the hold of the board, specifying a slot on the board can only be done by giving direction instructions to the professor. But this method is not only time consuming, it also reduces the interaction of the students and the professor to some extent. More importantly, this method might work for a CPU board, but when the lecture is about another object, which is much more complex and with much more tiny bits than a CPU board, simply moving a finger by following direction instructions might not be as efficient. Or, if the internet connection becomes too busy, the quality of the video being worse than expected and the details of the board not being able to show clearly raises the same problem.
Therefore, we need a faster and more visualised way for video conferences regarding an object, and hence improves the quality of the interaction and communication experience for the participants.
