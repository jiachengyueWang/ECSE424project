Observations:
Setting A: A lecture via videoconferencing
An electrical engineering professor is giving a lecture of CPU boards to students via an online platform, the professor is holding up a CPU board and explaining the functions of each section of the board. One of the students has a question about the board, the student wants to know the function of a slot on the board, the only way of communicating with the professor is through the audio. In order to know which part the student is referring to, the professor holds the board closer up to the camera, and moves his finger with directions the student gives until he reaches the right spot. The professor answers the question and keeps going with the explanation of the CPU board.
