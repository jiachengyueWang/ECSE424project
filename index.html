<b>  <font size="+2">Observations</font></b><br>
<b>Setting A: A lecture via videoconferencing </b><br>
An electrical engineering professor is giving a lecture of CPU boards to students via an online platform, the professor is holding up a CPU board and explaining the functions of each section of the board. One of the students has a question about the board, the student wants to know the function of a slot on the board, the only way of communicating with the professor is through the audio. In order to know which part the student is referring to, the professor holds the board closer up to the camera, and moves his finger with directions the student gives until he reaches the right spot. The professor answers the question and keeps going with the explanation of the CPU board. 

<br>
	
<b>Observations to persona:</b> In this scenario, the student is trying to specify the part of the CPU board that he has questions about to the professor, and eventually the professor managed to get to the right location by following the instructions the student gave. However, in the case of a more complex object, for example, a 3D model of the human nerve system, the actions taken in setting A would not be sufficient.  The observation leads to persona 1, David, the electrical engineering student.

<b>Setting B: A discussion via videoconferencing</b><br>
A team is working on building a 3D model of a temple, they made a model with the data collected from measuring the temple, but later on, they found out that some of the data collected were false, so they are having a video conference discussing the modifications required on the temple model. One of the team members has the hold of the model, the rest of the team members are feeding the member with the newly collected data information so that he can make marks of the locations that need modifications. One of the members suffers from social phobia, usually he just sends out text messages to work with the team, and it has been going smoothly until this incident. Under this circumstance, the best option would be to turn on the audio and the video to specify the location with the false data to the member with the hold of the model. The process is hard for him and takes a considerable amount of time. 

<br>

	
<b>Observations to persona:</b>  In this scenario, the member suffers from social phobia and has a hard time communicating with the rest of the team using video and audio. But knowing that guiding in text messages is not likely to help other members get the right location any time soon, in order to get the project done in time, he has to use body gestures and give direction instructions. Talking and using body gestures to a group of people can be very hard for someone suffering from social phobia, and if we have another alternative for addressing this problem, it does not just save time but also gives a more comfortable video conferencing environment for people with special needs.
The observation leads to persona 2, Roderick, the team member who suffers from social phobia.

<b>  <font size="+2">Problem</font></b><br>
Communicating in videoconference has always been a challenging task, even though we have both the video and audio synchronised nowadays, the experience of communicating in videoconference is not as real as the experience of an in-person meeting. 
The problem was observed in the settings described above in the observation section. Due to the limitations of the angle and the size of the camera, making the communication smoother is even more challenging in a meeting regarding complex objects or systems. Use the scenario stated in Observation 1, where a professor is giving a presentation of a CPU board, specifying a location on the board to the students is easy, since the professor has hold of the CPU board, he simply just needs to point to the object and that is clear enough to the students. But the other way around is tricky. In a presentation like this, it is likely that not all of the students  would have the hold of the same CPU board, and without the hold of the board, specifying a slot on the board can only be done by giving direction instructions to the professor. But this method is not only time consuming, it also reduces the interaction of the students and the professor to some extent. More importantly, this method might work for a CPU board, but when the lecture is about another object, which is much more complex and with much more tiny bits than a CPU board, simply moving a finger by following direction instructions might not be as efficient. Or, if the internet connection becomes too busy, the quality of the video being worse than expected and the details of the board not being able to show clearly raises the same problem.
Therefore, we need a faster and more visualised way for video conferences regarding an object, and hence improves the quality of the interaction and communication experience for the participants.

<b>  <font size="+2">Persona</font></b><br>
<b>Persona 1</b> : David <br>
Name: David <br>
Age: 21<br>
Occupation:An electrical engineering student in McGill University<br> 

David is good with school work and finds circuitry fascinating. He wants to know about every detail of the circuit board when he is shown one. However, since the pandemic started, all on campus activities are cancelled, all the courses are taught over online platforms. David finds it hard to study for circuitry, because circuit boards are mostly complex and composes of tiny bits. It is hard to see the details from videos and also harder to ask questions when he is not able to touch it.

<br>
<b>Persona 2 </b>: Roderick<br>
Name: Rodericl <br>
Age: 28 <br>
Occupation: An architect in a medium sized company<br>
Roderick is an architect, he suffers from social phobia, so he does not have a lot of friends and feels uncomfortable talking to strangers. However, his job includes a lot of model building, and if the model is complicated, then he gets assigned to a group working with other architects. Even though he works in a group with other people, he does not talk to other team mates a lot, he finishes the job that is assigned to him alone, and if he needs to discuss with other team members, he prefers communicating over text messages or other social media.

<p>Over the past decade, video-conferencing tools have been commonplace as more people have continued to use them over the years to either complement in-person meetings, to cut travel budgets, due to emergencies or for any other reasons.   With the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic that has led to many governments enforcing social distancing measures and travel restrictions, many would-be in-person activities have gone virtual, with products like Zoom, Hopin, Skype, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, FaceBook Live among others becoming the norm, from workplaces, to classrooms, worship places, fitness training, product launches and political campaign rallies, to name but a few.</p>

<p>These products have similar features in terms of live audio and video augmentation, with some having additional features like breakout rooms, raising hand, muting speakers, sharing screens, among others. However, these tools are not short of limitations, as they are geared towards live streaming and verbal interaction among the users, and do not provide a convenient way that could possibly simulate physical touching of things that could make the interactions with our two named persona’s more comfortable. </p>

<b>  <font size="+2">Product Comparison</font></b><br>
<p>Because most products that support video-calling are pretty similar in that most of them have collaboration tools, including share screen and breakout rooms, and both support call-ins, we would like to compare two of the most used: </p>
<p>Zoom: Zoom is the best option for setting up video meetings in a conference room. This is because it integrates with conferencing equipment to allow a lot more participants to join without having them tap in from individual devices while allowing up to 500 devices to stream the meeting at once. Though it has a free package available, you are limited in features including how long you can hold individual meetings. You also can't record and save your meetings with the Zoom free account. Paid accounts give all the features and tools you need, but it ends up costing much more than Google Meet.</p>

<p>Google Meet: Google Meet is a little more convenient than Zoom because it comes with every G Suite account, which several businesses already have available to its employees. But you can also use Meets with a personal Google account for free. You will just be limited to 60-minute meetings and won't be able to record and save meetings for later. Google Meet is also the better program if you have participants that need to call in rather than join via video because Google doesn't charge an additional call-in fee. Overall, Google is more cost-effective.

<b>  <font size="+2">Product Design</font></b><br>
<p>The feature will be deigned such that the presenter scans the object either in real-time or prior to the schedule video call. After the scan, the video could be embedded in the video-conference tool so that the audience can turn it in 3D and point quickly to any areas or points of interest on a screen shared with the presenter and the presenter can also broadcast to rest of the audience</p>

 </p>

<b>  <font size="+2">Feasibility Justification</font></b><br>
<p>
To avoid the circumstance mentioned above, we could design a function that can be implemented into ZOOM or any other video conferencing platforms.  When a presenter is trying to display an object like a PC board, it is barely possible to get all the details shown due to the internet speed or video quality. Audience may have the chance to click on the object to get the presenter’s notice by sending a vibrant message.</p>

<p>After getting the presenter’s permission, the camera would start to scan the object(the object is lifted  closer to the camera) in order to generate a more detailed and visualized picture of the object. Or it would find the best match online according to its model, size, color, and etc. Certainly, this process may take some time or even fail due to network fluctuations. However, presenters can upload their pictures/model beforehand if it is important to show to the audience. Once the audience receives the picture/model, they will have a better comprehension about the presentation contents and even come up with more detailed questions to the presenter.
